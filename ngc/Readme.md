## Directory Structure
- `/cmd` : Main applications inside. 
- `/pkg` : Lib code used by applications. Perphaps common libs such as lib or utils in the folder. 
- `/api` : Swagger JSON schema files inside. 
- `/dist` : Built golang binaries inside. 
- `/test` : Test apps and Test data inside. 
- `/configs` : Configuration files inside. 

## Download (My example: oam)
- Check GOPATH. My example is "/root/go"
- In `/root/go/src/github.com/otcshare/`, clone repos by `git clone https://github.com/otcshare/epcforedge.git`.
- Switch branch: `git checkout -b 5g_oamagent remotes/origin/5g_oamagent`.
- Enter into `/root/go/src/github.com/otcshare/epcforedge/ngc`.

## How to build oam sample bin and run it
* `make oam`
The bin will be generated under ngc/dist directory, used to build the OAM with API-stub backend (default mode).
Jus directly run bin as below:
`./dist/oam-stub`


* `make oam-test-stub`
It is same with 'make oam', used to build the OAM with API-stub backend.

* `make oam-test-flexcore`
It is used to build the OAM with Flexcore backend.

### make af
AF sample code, generated bin will be put under ngc/dist

### make help
IMPORTANT: understand make options by this help command


### make test-unit
It is used to run unit test

need to install ginkgo and generated unit test template as below:
$ go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
$ go get github.com/onsi/gomega/...
$ ginkgo bootstrap 

### make lint
need to install golangci-lint
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh| sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin v1.21.0
