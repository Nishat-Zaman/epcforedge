# 1. Introduction
## OAM Pkg source code
hello-world level sample code right now.
OAM core source files stay under ngc/pkg/oam directory.
OAM API-stub backend source files stay under ngc/test/oam/ directory.
OAM Flexcore backend source files stay under ngc/internal/flexcore/directory. 


## How to build oam sample bin and run it

Jus directly run bin as below:

* `make oam-test-stub`
It is same with 'make oam', used to build the OAM with API-stub backend.

* `make oam-test-flexcore`
It is used to build the OAM with Flexcore backend.
